# üåç Soil Moisture Trend Monitoring using Google Earth Engine & Python with Sentinel-2 data
This repository contains a Python-based workflow to analyze long-term soil moisture trends using Sentinel-2 data. The workflow leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE) for accessing and processing satellite imagery and employs remote sensing techniques to estimate soil moisture over extended periods. It provides an efficient way to monitor soil moisture dynamics, vegetation health, and their responses to climatic and environmental changes, all through Sentinel-2 imagery.
